    Title: "About me"
    Content: >
      - I am a software engineer with a deep passion for game development.

      - 

      - Gaming played a pivotal role in my childhood, shaping my imagination and guiding my career path. I strive to create experiences that resonate with players in the same way the games of my youth influenced me.

      -

      - My vision is to craft games that inspire, connect, and leave a lasting impression on players of all ages.

      -

      - Currently working as a Junior Software Engineer @ [Arkadium](https://www.arkadium.com/).
